                <h4>Music's History</h4>
                <p>
                    In all probability, music has played an important role in the lifecycle of humans perhaps 
                    even before we could speak. Significant evidence has been discovered that very early man 
                    developed primitive flutes from animal bones and used stones and wood as percussion.
                    Voice would have been the first and most natural means of expression in our distant ancestors, 
                    used to bond socially or comfort a sleepless child. It is from these humble beginnings that 
                    the music we enjoy today evolved.
                    As we move further through the history of music we find increasing evidence of its key role 
                    in sacred and secular settings, although the division into these categories was not defined 
                    in this way until many years later.
                    Influences from the west to the east merged into the pre-Christian music of the Greeks and 
                    later the Romans. Musical practices and conventions perhaps conveyed by travelling musicians 
                    brought a wealth of diversity and invention.
                    Surviving Greek notation from this period of musical history has given scientists and 
                    musicologists alike a vital clue to the way that the music of the time might have sounded. 
                    It certainly indicates remarkable links to the music that would follow, perhaps most notably 
                    through the use of modality in Greek music.
                    In the frescoes and in some written accounts, including the Bible, we have learned about 
                    the instruments that featured in the Roman and Greek times and their significance to the 
                    cultures. The trumpet as an instrument of announcement and splendid ceremony, or the lyre
                    as an integral player in the songs of poets.

            <h4 id="Creator">The Creator</h4>
                <p>
                    The question of “Who invented music?” does not have a single, definitive answer.
                    We cannot pinpoint a singular genius who sat down one day, plucked a string, or beat a drum, 
                    and thus invented music. Instead, the creation of music was a gradual evolutionary process, 
                    likely beginning with simple, rhythmic sounds from the far ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, 
                    and Egyptian civilizations and beyond.
                    Humans quite possibly began creating these initial sounds for numerous reasons, whether it 
                    was to express emotions, mimic nature, tell stories, or express their perceptions of the divine.
                    While humans are not the only species to exhibit musical behavior, we are the only ones with 
                    the creative ability to experiment, refine, and systematically organize sounds into music. 
                    As our brains developed, our capacity to recognize patterns, remember sequences, and 
                    anticipate musical structure emerged.
                    We see a telling sign of this in the fact that the auditory processing centers in our 
                    brains overlap with regions responsible for spatial reasoning and motor coordination. 
                    This overlap might be an evolutionary artifact reflecting a time when music and physical
                    movement (like dance or work-related rhythmic movement) were inextricably linked.

                <h4>How is MUSIC Formed</h4>
                <p>
                    In short, music is the art of combining and organizing sounds along with other elements in 
                    time to create a composition. It incorporates elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, and color 
                    to create a unique piece.
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Music also includes other elements like the pitch, which controls the melody and harmony, 
                    and the dynamics that affect its texture.</blockquote>
                    It’s one of humanity’s cultural aspects, usually used by humans to express emotions, 
                    statuses, events, and stories.
                    There are numerous types and music genres that either focus on or neglect these elements 
                    to create a new style with distinctive characteristics.
                    Music is performed using various musical instruments that can be incorporated with multiple 
                    vocal techniques.

                <h4>Sound Waves</h4>
                <p>
                    Sound waves are a type of energy that’s released when an object vibrates. Those acoustic 
                    waves travel from their source through air or another medium, and when they come into contact 
                    with our eardrums, our brains translate the pressure waves into words, music, or signals we 
                    can understand. These pulses help you place where things are in your environment.
                    We can experience sound waves in ways that are more physical, not just physiological, too. 
                    <blockquote class="border">If sound waves reach a microphone—whether it’s a plug-n-play USB livestream mic or a studio-quality 
                    microphone for vocals—it transforms them into electronic impulses that are turned back into sound by 
                    vibrating speakers. Whether listening at home or at a concert, we can feel the deep bass in our chest.</blockquote>
                    Opera singers can use them to shatter glass. It’s even possible to see sound waves sent through a medium 
                    like sand, which leaves behind a kind of sonic footprint. 
                    That shape is rolling peaks and valleys, the signature of a sine (aka sinusoid) wave. 
                    If the wave travels faster, those peaks and valleys form closer together. If it moves 
                    slower, they spread out. It’s not a poor analogy to think of them somewhat like waves in the 
                    ocean. It’s this movement that allows sound waves to do so many other things.

                <h4>The Ear and How we <b>Hear</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Hearing depends on a series of complex steps that change sound waves in the air into 
                    electrical signals. Our auditory nerve then carries these signals to the brain. Also 
                    available: Journey of Sound to the Brain, an animated video.
                    Sound waves enter the outer ear and travel through a narrow passageway called the ear canal, 
                    which leads to the eardrum.
                    The eardrum vibrates from the incoming sound waves and sends these vibrations to three tiny 
                    bones in the middle ear. These bones are called the malleus, incus, and stapes.
                    The bones in the middle ear amplify, or increase, the sound vibrations and send them to the 
                    cochlea, a snail-shaped structure filled with fluid, in the inner ear. An elastic partition 
                    runs from the beginning to the end of the cochlea, splitting it into an upper and lower part. 
                    This partition is called the basilar membrane because it serves as the base, or ground floor, 
                    on which key hearing structures sit.
                    Once the vibrations cause the fluid inside the cochlea to ripple, a traveling wave forms along 
                    the basilar membrane. Hair cells—sensory cells sitting on top of the basilar membrane—ride the 
                    wave. Hair cells near the wide end of the snail-shaped cochlea detect higher-pitched sounds, 
                    such as an infant crying. Those closer to the center detect lower-pitched sounds, such as a 
                    large dog barking.
                    As the hair cells move up and down, microscopic hair-like projections (known as stereocilia) 
                    that perch on top of the hair cells bump against an overlying structure and bend. Bending 
                    causes pore-like channels, which are at the tips of the stereocilia, to open up. When that 
                    happens, chemicals rush into the cells, creating an electrical signal.
                    The auditory nerve carries this electrical signal to the brain, which turns it into a sound 
                    that we recognize and understand.

                Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the most monumental and widely celebrated classical composers, 
                revolutionised the art form with his ground-breaking compositions and unmatched creative genius.
                In this guide, we will explore the genius behind Beethoven’s music, compositions and songs. 
                We will also look at his life, including early and later years, and how his music was affected 
                when he became deaf.
                This section will be an overview of Beethoven’s life, including information about his early 
                life and education, key career achievements and how he spent his later years.Early life and 
                education
                <span class="span">Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the most renowned composers in Western classical music, was born
                on December 17, 1770, in Bonn, a town in the Electorate of Cologne (now part of Germany).</span>
                His childhood was marked by both talent and tragedy.
                Beethoven was born into a musical family. His father, Johann van Beethoven, was a court 
                singer, and his grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven, was a respected musician. 
                Young Beethoven showed remarkable musical talent from an early age. His father recognised 
                this talent and began teaching him music while he was very young, hoping to replicate the 
                success of child prodigies like Mozart.
                However, Beethoven’s childhood was not without difficulties. Was known for his strict and 
                often harsh demeanour, which is often considered to have inspired his rebellious nature. 
                His mother, Maria Magdalena Keverich, played a nurturing role in his early years. However, 
                tragedy struck when Maria died in 1787 when Beethoven was just 16 years old. Her death had a 
                profound impact on Beethoven, leaving him emotionally scarred and possibly contributing to his 
                brooding and introspective temperament.
                <span class="span">Despite these challenges, Beethoven’s musical education flourished. He received formal training 
                from several notable musicians in Bonn, including Christian Gottlob Neefe, the court organist.</span>
                Under Neefe’s direction, Beethoven studied piano, violin, and organ, as well as music theory 
                and composition. Neefe recognized Beethoven’s exceptional talent and encouraged him to pursue 
                composition seriously.
                Beethoven’s education was not confined to formal instruction; he also learned through 
                experimentation and self-study. He was an avid reader and absorbed influences from a wide 
                range of sources, including literature, philosophy, and politics. This intellectual curiosity 
                infused his music with depth and complexity, setting him apart from his contemporaries.
